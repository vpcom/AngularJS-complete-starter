# AngularJS complete starter
AngularJS complete base application with all good practices.

PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This project aims at implementing many of AngularJS basic elements with all the good practice in order to help people learn AngularJS and also to provide a project that can be a good starter.

The noticeable features are for now:
- A directive.
- A factory service for providing data to the directive.

Concerning good practices, we have:
- A component based structure.
- The Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) syntax in all JavaScript files.
- The use of vm (view's model) variable to catch the context of this.
- The use of ng-cloack to avoid the display of uncompiled elements at first display.
- Named function to help the debugging.
- The use of the ControllerAS syntax.
- Dependency injection made separately for the sake of readability and for allowing non destructive minification.
- A separate app.module.js fine to create the main module and inject dependencies.
- JavaScript strict mode.

## todo
- Add the routing
- Add more style
- Build blocks
